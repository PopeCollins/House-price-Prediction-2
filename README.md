# House-price-Prediction-2
Using a data to predict the price of household
The previous analysis gives a very low test which failed in predicting the price of a household, in this project I converted the categorical data which is the city into numerical data in other to get a better picture of how the factors aligned can best predict the price of a household. 

## Conclusion
Basicallly 6.03% of the test signify that the independent variables which are (Bathroom, Living Rohadom, floor square metter etc) had a very low prediction on the house price.

6.03% had a little difference from the prevoius project on house price prediction having transform the categorical variable (city) to numerical variable using one hot encoding. However, the factors does'nt say much about the price of the house. In the next project I will work on tackling the outlier in the data set so as so get the real picture of the data.
